# Spamcaster 1800 + Meshtastic Hydra

![InternalRender](https://github.com/sniporbob/Spamcaster/blob/main/Spamcaster-1800-Hydra/V1.0/InternalRender.png)

This version is not for the faint of heart. It requires custom ordering a Hydra board from a PCB fabrication company and hand assembly of some final components.
The outcome, however, is a Spamcaster that can also function as a meshtastic node with either 1W or 2W of transmit power (depending on if you select the E22-900M30S or E22-900M33S).

Use a small bluetooth PCB antenna and secure with adhesive to the inside of the Spamcaster case.

See https://github.com/Hydra-Designs/project-hydra-meshtastic-pcb for more info about the Hydra board.
